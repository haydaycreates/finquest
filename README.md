FinQuest is a mobile‑first, gamified financial literacy web app designed for Indian students and young adults. It turns complex money concepts into bite‑sized lessons, XP, levels, and badges, making learning feel like a game instead of a boring course.Users progress through 15 units covering budgeting, credit, loans, insurance, investing, scams, taxes, careers, and more. Interactive tools like a 50/30/20 budget planner, SIP and EMI calculators, and streak tracking help learners apply concepts to real life. Built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, FinQuest runs entirely in the browser with local progress storage.
